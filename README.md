# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning. It follows a structured, beginner-friendly approach to introduce concepts from MLOps and DataOps.

Project Structure
/data: Contains the raw and processed datasets.

/notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

/src: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.

/models: Saved machine learning models.

/reports: Generated reports, plots, and analysis.
